<h2> Method</h2>
<p>The first website was bordentown.k12.nj.us. This page targeted students and parents. The three tasks were to, go to the middle school page, locate the algebra I teacher, and find how to contact her. The second page was, art.yale.edu, which is targeted to art students. The tasks were to go to the website, go to summer programs, and find the contact information for applying. The final website was, tsaweb.org, which is directed towards middle school and high school students in TSA. The three tasks were to find the national conference tab, find the information about the  2014 competition and find the location and contact information. </p>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>On the bordentown school page, it was difficult to locate the exact teacher of the given subject, but it was easier since the subject was familiar with the website. It took a minimum amount of time and steps to accomplish the task. On art.yale.edu, it was more challenging to navigate the website. The subject had never visited the website and it was not layed out in a clear manor. It took a decent amount of time to arrive at the destination, however, it was simple to find main tabs. It was more difficult to boil it down to specific topics. The tsa website was the easiest out of all three websites. Each tab was specific enough for the user to find the information needed. It hardly took any time at all and there were very few steps necessary.</p>
<h2> Discussion</h2>
<p>I think this study was very important because usability is an essential characteristic that determines the success of the website. The design of the first two websites definitely requires some improvement to create a more simple, streamlined appearance. Adding a keyword search bar on the websites would be of great assistance for users so that they can arrive at specific information quickly and without having to search around the entire website. </p>
