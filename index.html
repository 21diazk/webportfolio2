<h3 class= "review">Unit 2</h3>
I learned all about HTML in unit 2. We created a site practicing these tags and how to present them on a webpage. Using just HTML on a website does not make for a very eye-catching page. However, it does incorpate the foundation of it and provides all the content. With HTML, the website is made accessible to many people. All the information is typed out and images can be added from the internet as well as videos. HTML is a good markup language to start out with since it is rather basic and creativity is not really involved. There are different types of tags in the language, container and non-container tags. Container tags have content within them and have a closing tag. These types of tags include body. Noncontainer tags do not have anything in them. For example, line break.</p>

In unit 3, I learned how to style my web page using CSS. I learned the two ways of using this, internal styling and external. When using internal, the CSS codes are in the same document that the html content is in. External is coding on a seperate document and the CSS link is added into the html page. Using CSS adds a lot to the webstite and truly brings the page to life. It can be frusterating to use because if something considerably small, like a semicollon is left out, the entire desing will not show up. There are more tags that go into creating the final product in CSS. For example, a table requires padding, border width, font size, font family and more to become a complete table.</p>

<h3 class= "review">Unit 4</h3>
In unit 4, the main topic was graphics. We learned about creating a photo album and designing a button. To start, the importance of graphic on a webpage was discussed. It's important to include useful images that are not overwhelming. Next, we learned about copyright and how everything on the web is copyrighted by default. However, it is always a good idea to receive futher protection to ensure credit for your work. Following that, we chose images that would be displayed on the site. These graphics were then edited and created into thumbnails or backdrops. They were then shown on the site as a photo album. Finally, we created buttons for the page. While working with photoshop, mail and photo buttons. Lastly was creating a favicon which appears in the address bar and shows a symbol of your site.

In unit 5, we learned client-side script, server-side script, creating a JavaScript alert, debugging, and building a clock. Client-side script is executed within the browser. Old browsers do not support this type of scripting and new browsers provide an option to turn it off. Server side are executed before the page is sent to the browser. They cannot be read by the user. To create an alert, you add code to the page and create an option to 'show alert.' By doing this a notification will pop up and show a message. Debugging will show any errors in the code that could potentially cause a problem. When a clock is added to the webpage, it will show the exact time, to the second, on your screen.

Unit 6 included validating the html and css of the web portfolio. In addition, the sites were tested for usability to ensure that visitors would be able to use the site easily.

<h3 class= "review">Unit 7<br/></h3>
During unit 7, we explored different web authoring tools and CMS's. In adobe dreamweaver, we uploaded our portfolios and edited them on there instead to compare the differences. In the following lessons, it discussed hosting services and publishing tools.
