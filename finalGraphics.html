<h2 id="evaluation"/>Evaluation of Web Graphics</h2>
<h3>Website: apple.com</h3>
<p>The purpose of the graphics on this webpage is to portray information, have contrast from the background, 
and to emphasize the important information that is the new products being sold. The images are of the latest products and how they are sleeker and more powerful. There is a wide range of items from the latest phone to world wide conferences they are hosting. It gives viewers a futuristic view yet it still includes how the brand is trying to build a community around the world</p>
<p>The web page succeeds in meeting most of the guidelines in creating a successful website. Although the site runs smoothly and rapidly, the images take up the majority of the home page and the graphics are the only way the information is displayed which can be inconveinent to some users. The homepage displays an overview of the information contained on the other tabs and each page has appealing contrast. The images are all bright but they are not overbearing. Most of the text is not displayed on images which makes the content portrayed clearly. Overall, the entire apple website is easily identifiable and very smooth. </p>
<h2 id="filetypes">Graphic File Types</h2>
<ul><h3>Image 1:</h3> The file format that would be most appropriate for inserting image 1 on a web page would be, SVG. The image is a bar graph and SVG is a format that is good at displaying logos and images with strong design.</ul> 
<ul><h3>Image 2:</h3> This image of a monkey would be displayed well using the JPEG format. This format is best for photography and still images. The monkey in the picture is has no movement and the picture has many complex colors with many different shades.</ul>
<ul><h3>Image 3:</h3> The mountain image can be displayed with JPEG because behind the mountain there is a sunset with an array of different colors and shades. The image was obviously photographed by a profesional camera and does not require much editing</ul>
<ul><h3>Image 4:</h3> The puzzle pieces can be shown with PNG. The pieces need a transparency behind them since they are not connected. The colors are dark but simple and there are many curves in each piece and they are all complex sizes and shapes.</ul>
<ul><h3>Image 5:</h3> The stop sign can be displayed using SVG because it is a logo. The shape is a bit complex and it has a strong color.</ul>
