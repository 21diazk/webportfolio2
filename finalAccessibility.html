<h2>Accessibility Review of the Bordentown Regional School District Home Page</h2>
<p>On the Bordentown web page, no errors surfaced, however there was several alerts, features, structural elements and contrast errors. The alerts included suspicious alternate text, a nonscript element, as well as links to PDFs. The alternate text for some of the content was not a detailed enough description of the text for other users to understand. For example, the image displayed for an announcement about a food service management program. The only content on the image was," Important announcement". This does not provide enough information for users with disabilities. Users will not know that the important announcement has to do with a program. To correct this alert, I would have added a more descriptive image that embodied the news. </p>
